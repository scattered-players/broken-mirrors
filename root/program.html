As a veteran of the Zoomverse, J has kept himself busy by performing in various readings and workshopping new works. If the state of the world continues the way it is, J will soon be found in a hiatus some may describe as hibernation. These measures will be taken to give his liver time to recover from all of the drunk googling of K-pop dance routine how-to videos. He will next be seen in Third Wall Productions' A Christmas Carol Podcast, playing an audio version of himself.

            Heiko is incredibly grateful to be back working with Scattered Players In his 20 years on and off stage, Heiko has worked with virtually every small theatre in the Baltimore area. Personal highlights include co-founding Guerrilla Theatre Front, performing countless hours of improvised comedy with The Early Monday Morning Show and Drop Three, portraying Doctor Everett Scott in the Rocky Horror Show, stage managing and sound designing Mr Burns: A Post-Electric Play and far too much 4 a.m. sleep-deprived set building. Heiko would like to thank the cast and crew for their passion, and his family, both blood and assimilated, and especially Mrs. Awesomesauce, for their constant support. Also, if today is your birthday, happy birthday to you!
